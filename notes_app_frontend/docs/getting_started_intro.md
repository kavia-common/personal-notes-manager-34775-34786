# Blits - Lightning 3 App Development Framework

With Blits, the App Development Framework for Lightning 3, it becomes a breeze to build great Lightning 3 applications.

Blits is built on top of the Lightning 3 Renderer and aims to provide a great developer experience, making it fun and easy to build your apps!

Built from the ground up by the LightningJS team, we're offering a Complete App framework, full of features to speed up development, while keeping it lightweight with a focus on performance.

The Blits framework uses a readable XML-style template syntax and comes with built-in reactivity.

## Ocean Notes Theme

This project applies the Ocean Professional theme (blue primary and amber accents) with a modern, minimalist design. Colors are defined as CSS variables in src/styles/theme.css and applied via component color properties (Lightning uses WebGL colors in hex, e.g., 0x2563EB).
